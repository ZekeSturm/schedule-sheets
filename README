ScheduleSheets is (well, will be as of may 18th) an app designed around scheduling events involving multiple people. Events can be created and shared with a simple link. You don't need to register to use it, but registered users will be able to plan their schedule on the site and (eventually, hopefully) receive email (and possibly SMS) alerts as events get nearer. As of right now it's mostly just back end centered around the user login, creating secure passwords, and setting up the database along with a simple test UI.
